 * Helper for dynamically loading module that should work with linked dependencies.
 * The problem is that we _should_ be using `require(require.resolve(moduleName, { paths: [cwd()] }))`
 * However it's _not possible_ to do that with Webpack, as it has to know all the dependencies during
 * build time. `require.resolve` is also not available in any other way, so we cannot create,
 * a fake helper like we do with `dynamicRequire`.
 *
 * We always prefer to use local package, thus the value is not returned early from each `try/catch` block.
 * That is to mimic the behavior of `require.resolve` exactly.
 *
 * @param moduleName module name to require
 * @returns possibly required module
